## REVENUE PREDICTION 

 In this Project I have built a Machine Learning Model to predicting Future Revenue to use Google Analytics data that can answer any kind of user Query related to Website Traffic and user behavior. 

### Project Goals

 1. Predicting Future revenue 2. Data Visualization 

### Project Objective
 
 To analyzed website traffic data to understand user behavior, optimize website performance and improve user engagement, identify key performance.
 
 ### Tools I have used for this Project are: 
 
 1. For Analysis and Predicting i have used Python, Machine Learning and Stats.
 2. For Data Visualization I have used Power bi to Create a Dashboard to show Trend Analysis.

### Data Source 

Google_Analytics Data: The Primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Google_Analytics.xlsx

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase,we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspectons.
2. Handaling Missing Values.
3. Data Cleaning and Formating 

### Model Building 

First i did As part of the project, I conducted correlation analysis using a heatmap to understand relationships between variables derived from Google Analytics data.

Implemented a train-test split to evaluate model performance.

Applied scaling techniques to normalize data for optimal model performance.

Utilized Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as a metric to assess model accuracy.


I tried two different Models:

1.Logistic Regression

2.K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor

### Model Performance 

Logistic Regression: 0.87

K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor: 0.90

### Results

Evaluated the effectiveness of each model using RMSE and other relevant metrics.

Compared model performance to identify strengths and weaknesses.
